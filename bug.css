The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results due to unit incompatibility or missing spaces. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, but `width:calc(100%-10px);` might not.  Another common error is using `calc()` with incompatible units, such as `width: calc(100% - 10em);` which might render differently than expected across various screen sizes.
